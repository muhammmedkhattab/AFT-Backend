**Reporting:**

 Regarding the reporting I already integrated and implemented the allure report as it has many advantages for example if the business are
 not involved in the project and they want to see a good looking report that they can understand it as we can add "story,feature,link..etc"
 Allure Report is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation
 of what have been tested in a neat web report form,but allows everyone participating in the development process
 to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests, it easier than implementation the whole BBD from scratch from my perspective
 and from a technical part we could se the Request and respond in simple way in the Report.

 On the other hand,from a CI point of view, it can be easily integrated for example to Jenkins there is a plugin called "allure-plugin"
 that we can configure it then any one who runs the tests can start seeing the report there fore is reusable report that can integrate the
 whole team together.

 Finally I added some images to my last run with allure report in the email
