**Reporting:**

 Regarding the reporting I already integrated and implemented the allure report as it has many advantages
 for example if the business are not involved in the project and they want to see a good looking report that
 they can understand it as we can add "story,feature,link..etc" everything exact like
 Allure Report is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation
 of what have been tested in a neat web report form,but allows everyone participating in the development process
 to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests,
 it is easier than implementing the whole BBD from scratch from my perspective
 and from a technical part we could display the Request and respond in simple way in the Report.

 On the other hand,regarding the CI point of view, it can be easily integrated for example in Jenkins there is a plugin called "allure-plugin"
 that we can configure it, then anyone who runs the tests can display the report therefore it is reusable report that can integrate easily
 for the whole team together. Also I am open for any other tool that makes sense and really help out the whole team

 Finally I added some images to my last run with allure report in the email.
